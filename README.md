## Project Overview

- **Encryption and Decryption:**  
  - Uses Fernet from the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt data.
- **Secure Password Hashing:**  
  - Uses the `bcrypt` library to hash and verify passwords securely.
- **Portfolio Website:**  
  - Showcases the project with a clean, user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Basic Encryption and Decryption
- **Goal:**  
  - Encrypt and decrypt a string using Fernet from the `cryptography` library.
- **Libraries:**  
  - Python: `cryptography` (Fernet)

### Task 2: Implement Password Hashing
- **Goal:**  
  - Hash and verify passwords securely.
- **Libraries:**  
  - Python: `bcrypt`

### Portfolio Website
- **Goal:**  
  - Present the project in an accessible and visually appealing way.
- **Technologies:**  
  - HTML, CSS

## Libraries and Technologies

- **Python:**  
  - `cryptography` (Fernet) for encryption and decryption.
  - `bcrypt` for password hashing.
- **Web:**  
  - HTML, CSS for the portfolio website.

## Security Notes

- **Password hashing with bcrypt** ensures passwords are stored securely, protecting user credentials even if data is compromised.
- **Encryption with Fernet** provides strong symmetric encryption for sensitive data.
